Problem 1:
Create a class Dog. Make sure it has the properties name, breed, color, gender. Create a method that will print all of the properties. Create two objects of the class.

Problem 2:
Put the start of your program in a main function. Create a loop that takes user input and put it in an array. Once the user quits, print all items in the array. DO NOT print the array, print the items/elements in the array.
